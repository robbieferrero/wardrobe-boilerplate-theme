HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast,
robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

Wardrobe is designed to be a very minimal blogging platform with the primary focus on writing. Currently it is a work in progress but you are free to give it a try. (Just be warned this alpha/beta quality). If you have any issues or ideas please report them.
